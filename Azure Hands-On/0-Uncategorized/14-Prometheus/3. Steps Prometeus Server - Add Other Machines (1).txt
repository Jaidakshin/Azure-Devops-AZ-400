Now as the Prometheus server is only collecting logs from localhost, we need to connect it to other VMs also

1. RDP to Prometheus Server
2. Open C:\Prometheus folder
3. Open prometheus.yml file 
4. Change target in the last line
5. Stop the Prometheus Server and start again
6. Open the Prometheus Server URL
7. Open Status\Configuration and notice the changes
8. Query data to see the logs
