To use Azure Build Pipelines to deploy the image as container to AKS

1. Open the AKS cluster
2. Delete the service and the workload
3. Open Azure Repo - docker-repo and upload app.yaml (aks_app.yaml) and service.yaml (aks_service.yaml) files
4. Build Pipeline will be run automaticall. But we don't need it. Let's cancel it.
5. Edit existing pipeline of docker-repo to add 2 more tasks to it
    - Task1: CopyFiles (app.yaml, service.yaml) to build machine
    - Task2: KubernetesManifest: Allows to deploy those YAML files
7. Create a service connection to connect to AKS
8. Open Project Settings\Service Connection\New Service Connection
9. Chose Kuberneties
10. Chose Azure Subscription and select existing AKS cluster
11. Service COnnection Name - cluster-connection
12. Save and Cancel the build
13. Change in Source Code - Pages\Index file - "Welcome to Azure Pipelines- Kubernetes"
14. Take the IP address of AKS\Service and open in browser
